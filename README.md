# ComicsBot

ComicsBot can currently entertain you with 8 different web-comics (xkcd, SMBC, Abstruse Goose, Extra Ordinary, Poorly Drawn Lines, Dilbert, PhD comics, and Tom Gauld's) and with NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (because these pics are cool!).
It can show you the latest comic or a random one.
Type "start" to see the options.

You can also subscribe for updates, that would be checked daily at 13:37.
Type "subscribe" for that.

That's all, folks :)
